          <p>Creativity has now slaved knowledge and this fact is already realized by many top schools of Odisha. Such schools organize exhibitions and seminars to enhance the studentâ€™s knowledge and make learning a fun experience where it is comparatively easy on the part of the teacher to teach and light for the students to learn new things very easily in a better way. In a developing country like India, science embedded with creativity has a vital role to play in progressive development. Science has always proved to be a blessing to mankind and thus it is very important to enhance the interest of students in science and technology. One best way to do this is by organizing science exhibitions in school. </p>
